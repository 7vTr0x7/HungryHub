   -> Class-based components are js class that extends React. Component 
      -> and it has render() method that returns JSX

  # - 
   -> Never update the state variables directly       


  # life Cycle

   # ex. if the parent is a functional component
    -> Suppose userClass is a class-based component and it is inside the About Component
    -> 
    -> When the About component is called it starts rendering/loading/mounting the component line by line when it reaches userClass 
    -> then it starts loading userClass 
       -> Now the new instance of this class is created
       -> When this class is instantiated
          -> First the constructor is called
          -> then render() is called

  # life Cycle

    #ex.  if the parent and child are both class-based components

     -> First the parent life cycle will be triggered
      -> parent constructor will be called
        -> Then parent render() will be called
         -> Then rendering starts in render there is a child component loading/mounting/rendering goes to the child meanwhile parents mounting hasn't finished yet

         -> child life cycle will be triggered
           -> parent constructor will be called
           -> then child render()
           -> Then the child componentDidMount will be called

      -> After all this once the child has been mounted successfully the parent componentDidMount will be called

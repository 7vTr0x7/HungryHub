  # Why react.js is fast?
  -> Because react is doing efficient dom-manipulation
     how?
     -> because it has a virtual dom
     -> react.js has diff also which finds out the difference between old virtual dom and new virtual dom and updates the UI


    how react.js works behind the scenes
    - 
    - " reconciliation algo " 
    - whenever something changes on UI it is known as reconciliation 

    # In React16 new algo "React fiber" came out to update the dom
    -  it is new to finding a diff and updating the dom

    - react uses " reconciliation algo " which is also known as " React fiber "

    ex.

           dom               filtered ->            dom              
            |                                        | 
        res-container                           res-container
        |   |   |  |                              |      |
        c1  c2 c3  c4                             c1     c4 
     

    in dom we have res-container and cards we filtered 4 cards to 2 cards
    now ui changes


    # react.js creates a virtual dom
     - virtual dom is a representation of the actual dom
     
     - virtual dom is an Object 
     - just like React.Element



   # diff algo  

   
           dom               filtered ->            dom              
            |                                        | 
        res-container                           res-container
        |   |   |  |                              |      |
        c1  c2 c3  c4                             c1     c4 
     
       old virtual dom                          new virtual dom


    - diff algo tries to find out the difference between old virtual dom and new virtual dom   
    
    - after calculating the difference then it will update dom on every render cycle
    - react render cycle is fast
   - thats how react.js becomes faster
